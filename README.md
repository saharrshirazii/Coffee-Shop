# Coffee Shop Project
I created my project using HTML, CSS, and javaScript. It is responsive across various size of screen.

## Steps:
I implemented: 
1. I desigined a menu witch will change to the hamburger menu across tablet and mobile.
2. A Hero Section for my first page.
3. A flexbox gallery.
4. A .gif image for my hours part.
5. A footer.
6. A recipes page witch when I click on different buttons the data will change.
